    World population estimates from 1800 to 2100, based on "high", "medium" and "low" United Nations projections in 2015 and UN historical estimates for pre-1950 data Population growth graph generated with data supplied by World Bank, via Google World population
    percentage by country In demographics, the world population is the total number of humans currently living, and was estimated to have reached 7.6 billion people as of May 2018.[1] It took over 200,000 years of human history for the world's population
    to reach 1 billion;[2] and only 200 years more to reach 7 billion.[3] World population has experienced continuous growth since the end of the Great Famine of 1315–17 and the Black Death in 1350, when it was near 370 million.[4] The highest population
    growth rates – global population increases above 1.8% per year – occurred between 1955 and 1975, peaking to 2.06% between 1965 and 1970.[5] The growth rate has declined to 1.18% between 2010 and 2015 and is projected to decline further in the course
    of the 21st century.[5] Total annual births were highest in the late 1980s at about 139 million,[6] and as of 2011 were expected to remain essentially constant at a level of 135 million,[7] while deaths numbered 56 million per year and were expected
    to increase to 80 million per year by 2040.[8] The median age of the world's population was estimated to be 30.4 years in 2018.[9]
